student at ESTIN
progressing well thus far
the people here are amiable
most of them, at least
a few evoke a sense of discomfort
when I encounter them, memories resurface
I experience a flashback of joyful moments
I reminisce about what was or what could have been
and then I am reminded that it is over
I grapple with the notion that it was my fault
I was not responsible, mature, or prepared enough
I fell short for that person
when they needed me the most
this will serve as a reminder for me
a needle that pricks every time I grow complacent
or lose sight of my purpose or aspirations in life
next time, I shall be ready
not for you
but for me
